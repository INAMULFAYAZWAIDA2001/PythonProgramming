#This calculator is made using the basic functions, we shall modify it with time. 


#Lets suppose two variable with two integers respectively

a = 50
b = 3

print("The value of", a, "+", b, "is: ", a+b)
print("The value of", a, "-", b, "is: ", a-b)
print("The value of", a, "x", b, "is: ", a*b)
print("The value of", a, "/", b, "is: ", a/b)
